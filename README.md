# Compliance task library

**Contents of this repository are intended for internal Microsoft use.**

This repository contains Azure DevOPS YAML template for the compliance tasks needed for release products.
The step templates can be included in the repository using [multi-checkout](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/multi-repo-checkout?view=azure-devops).

The following sample shows how the templates can be included in your release YAML.

1. Create a repository resource and a service connection to connect to this repository.

   ```yaml
   resources:
     repositories:
     - repository: ComplianceRepo
       type: github
       endpoint: ComplianceGHRepo
       name: adityapatwardhan/compliance
   ```

1. In the compliance stage, checkout `self` repo and the `compliance` repo.

    ```yaml
    - stage: compliance
      displayName: Compliance
      dependsOn: Build
      jobs:
      - job: Compliance_Job
          pool:
          name: Package ES CodeHub Lab E
          steps:
          - checkout: self
          - checkout: ComplianceRepo
    ```

1. Pick one of the three composed templates,

    - `assembly-module-compliance.yml` - for running compliance for projects generating an assembly.
    - `script-module-compliance.yml` - for running compliance for projects generating a script module.
    - `ci-compliance.yml` - for running compliance as part of CI builds.

1. Call the template from this repo in your yaml file and specify the values for the parameters.

    ```yaml
    - template: assembly-module-compliance.yml@ComplianceRepo
        parameters:
            # binskim
            AnalyzeTarget: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)/*.dll'
            AnalyzeSymPath: 'SRV*'
            # component-governance
            sourceScanPath: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)'
            # credscan
            suppressionsFile: ''
            # TermCheck
            optionsRulesDBPath: ''
            optionsFTPath: ''
            # tsa-upload
            codeBaseName: 'PSPager_202007'
            # selections
            APIScan: false # set to false when not using Windows APIs.
    ```

## ESRP Template Example

** Requires on-boarding, see the wiki in the internal PowerShell Maintainers teams channel **

Make sure to create the variable group named `ESRP` and make it available to the pipeline.
Details can be found in the PowerShell Maintainers teams channel's Wiki tab.

1. Call the template from this repo in your yaml file and specify the values for the parameters.

    ```yaml
    - template: EsrpSign.yml@ComplianceRepo
        parameters:
           # the folder which contains the binaries to sign
           buildOutputPath: $(signSrcPath)
           # the location to put the signed output
           signOutputPath: $(signOutPath)
           # the certificate ID to use
           certificateId: "CP-230012"
           # the file pattern to use, comma separated
           pattern: '*.dll,*.psd1,*.psm1,*.ps1xml,*.mof'
    ```
